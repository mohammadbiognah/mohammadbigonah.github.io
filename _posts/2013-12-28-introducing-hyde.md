## About me!

##### Welcome! I started my PhD Candidate in Disaster Prevention at the [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) (Harbin), China, under the supervision of [Prof. Shuang Li](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/lishuang) in 2022. My research focuses on advanced approaches to mitigate and prevent damages caused by Resilience Progressive collapse. I obtained my MSc. degree (2018) in Earthquake Engineering, at the [Iran University of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en), supervised by [Prof. Mohsen Ali Shayanfar](http://www.iust.ac.ir/content/17171/Dr.-M.A.-Shayanfar). My master's thesis was “New Techniques for Retrofitting of RC Frame against Progressive Collapse”.

## RESEARCH TECHNIQUES

 ##### My research interests include new techniques in modelling and Improve [Progressive Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_collapse) methods for structures,Moreover, Network Resilience, with the goal of contributing to disaster prevention and mitigation. These research topics"Believe Rule  Base with [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), artificial Intelligence, as well as Smart technologies.I also have expertise in  Seismic Retrofitting of Structural Vibration Controls and bridges and high-rise buildings.
